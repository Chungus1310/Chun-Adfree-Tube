# 🎬 ChunTube - Watch YouTube Your Way!

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to ChunTube, my fun little project that lets you watch YouTube videos without all those pesky ads. Built this bad boy using Streamlit because, well, why make things complicated? 😎

## ✨ What's Cool About It?

- 🚫 **No Ads, No Nonsense**: Watch videos without interruptions (because ads are so 2010)
- 📥 **Grab Videos**: Download stuff to watch offline when you're stuck on a plane or something
- 🔍 **Super Search**: Find videos and channels faster than you can say "cat videos"
- 📺 **Channel Surfing**: Hop between your favorite channels like a pro
- 🎨 **Looks Pretty Good**: Clean design that won't hurt your eyes
- ⚡ **Quick AF**: Smart caching so you're not waiting forever
- 📱 **Works Everywhere**: Use it on your phone, tablet, whatever!

## 🛠️ Getting This Party Started

1. Grab the code:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chungus1310/Chun-Adfree-Tube.git
cd Chun-Adfree-Tube
```

2. Install the goods:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Get your YouTube API key (I know, I know, but we need it 😅):
   - Pop over to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
   - Make a project (or use an old one)
   - Turn on YouTube Data API v3
   - Get yourself an API key

## 🎮 How to Use This Bad Boy

1. Fire it up:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Throw in your API key
3. Search for whatever floats your boat
4. Enjoy your ad-free YouTube life! 🎉
